### <u>if-else-elif</u>
 - EX:  
if int(age) == 21:
    print("You are a great age to party")  
elif  int(age) >= 21:
    print("You are old enough")  
else       
    print("You are too young!")  
#can also be 'elif' doesnt have to end in 'else'.  
can have as many elif statements as needed but if too many maybe question if there's a better way to code the problem.

<code>if int(rando_number) > 42:  
    print("Number too high!")  
elif int(rando_number) < 42:  
    print("number too low!")  
elif int(rando_number) == 42:  
    print("number is correct")</code>
